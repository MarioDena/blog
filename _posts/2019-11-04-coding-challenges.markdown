**A coding challenge is a great way to test your skills** or simply refresh your memory on the language of choice. So I decided to solve some challenges and show you how I got to the answer I'm presenting.

This time, I will be solving ["Angry Professor"][AN] an easy difficulty challenge on [Hackerrank.][hk] 

This problem is a perfect introduction for me to show you an easy way to think about the problems found on some simple coding challenges. But **please feel free to submit a coding challenge** on the comments or by [twitter][tw] if you want to see me solving it, either to compare results or because you are stuck, and I might post a new video featuring your pick.

This time I will show you 3 different ways to solve the challenge and we will have a **quick look on some interesting syntax and features from ES6 Javascript**.

Enjoy!

As you can see in the video, **the real problem about this coding challenge is understanding the problem,** forgetting about writing code for a moment, and think about a solution. Then we translate that solution into code.

I hope all of you enjoyed the video and please, share any feedback or suggestions you might have to make my content better.

Happy Coding!
