`Coding challenges` aren't a real challenge if you are mentally prepared to solve them. **They aren't meant to show off,** no, in a coding challenge you show your ability to solve a problem. At least in my experience, you can actually solve most of them with very basic knowledge of a selected programming language. 

For me, **coding challenges are part of the path to become a master programer, not a way to prove you already are the one.**

During my life as a student _(yes I'm an old man but still...)_ I have seen some of my peers having real problems when solving even easy difficulty challenges on Hackerrank. So, today I want to share with you some solutions and my thought process while solving some of said problems.

Enjoy!
