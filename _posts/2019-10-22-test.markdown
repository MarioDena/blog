`BEM` stands for Block-Element-Modifier and it's basicaly a [naming convention][nc], or set of rules you can use to name your HTML elements _(with classes)_, no installation needed no prerequisites, you can simply start using it now.

You can watch this video for a quick run-down.



Simple as it sounds, **it's a fantastic tool**. You can use and _modify_ it to your needs. And if used right, you will get **clean, readable, reusable and easy to maintain** code. Both for your HTML and your CSS.

**So, let's see what `BEM` can do for us.**

Let's say we want to make a `navbar` and we have our general layout looking like this:

{% highlight html %}

<div class="container">
  <ul>
    <li>item</li>
    <li>item</li>
    <li>item</li>
    <li>item</li>
  </ul>
  <button><p>Sign in</p></button>
  <button><p>Action</p></button>
  <img src="" alt="logo" />
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

We can always try to be specific with our selectors, and style doing something similar to this:

**CSS:**

{% highlight css %}
.container > ul {
  display: flex;
}
{% endhighlight %}

However as the files grow bigger _(both html and css)_ you'll have to remember what is what the whole time, and that will be a problem in the long run. So, as a student I learnt that we should use classes for styling, [never use ID's for styling][nv] and some the general [best paractices][bp].

But what name can we give to each element? For example:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="container">
  <ul class="menuList">
    <li>item</li>
    ......
{% endhighlight %}

There _seems_ to be nothing wrong with the code above, however what if you have more than one `menuList` on your website? What if we want _them_ to look diferent?

Then we have to be more specific, and use less generic but equaly descriptive names. And here is where BEM will help us out.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mainNavBar">
  <ul class="mainNavBar__menuList">
    <li>item</li>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
.mainNavBar {
  display: flex;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 45px; 
}

.mainNavBar__menuList{
  display: flex;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So we name our `block` with a descriptive name, and use double underscores for our elements. `__element` 

Now the code is clean and easy to maintain, even if I come back to the code after a month or a year after writing it, I would know just by reading the names what every part of my code represenst.

Now let's get into what I love the most about BEM, what about our `li` elements? Well, you might be inclined to do something like this:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mainNavBar">
  <ul class="mainNavBar__menuList">
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuList__menuItem">item</li>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

And while it would work, we have to remember that in BEM the hirarchy is defined by our naming standard and not by our HTML (at least not as much). So we can either leave it as a `li` element, or we could do this:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mainNavBar">
  <ul class="mainNavBar__menuList">
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuItem">item</li>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
.mainNavBar {
  display: flex;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 45px; 
}

.mainNavBar__menuList{
  display: flex;
}

.mainNavBar__menuItem{
  font-size: 16px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

What I love about this aproach is we can get single name classes for our styling, and we keep everything organized, but as our site grows _(or if we want to go crazy with styling)_ we will find that we need to be even more specific, and here is where modifiers came in.

Let's say we want only one element in our list to be in italics. There are several ways you can do it, there is the BEM way, doing something like this:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mainNavBar">
  <ul class="mainNavBar__menuList">
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuItem">item</li>
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuItem mainNavBar__menuItem--italics">item</li>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
.mainNavBar {
  display: flex;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 45px; 
}

.mainNavBar__menuList{
  display: flex;
}

.mainNavBar__menuItem{
  font-size: 16px;
}

.mainNavBar__menuItem--italics{
  font-style: italic;
}

{% endhighlight %}

So now we have our `block` our `__element` adn following the double dash standard our `--modifier`.

What's so cool about this, and what I love the most, is that we can _bend_ the rules a little bit. This is enterely a personal preference and a way I _(sometimes)_ deal with my modifiers. 

If my modifier is so simple as to just change the font style to italics, I then add it to my css with all my helper classes like this:

{% highlight css %}
.--italics{
  font-style: italic;
}

.--bolded{
  font-weight: bold;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we are not following the BEM standards, but we made our own modification to the rule, _(for more complicated styles I do follow BEM)_ and our HTML is clean and has great readability.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="mainNavBar">
  <ul class="mainNavBar__menuList">
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuItem">item</li>
    <li class="mainNavBar__menuItem --italics">item</li>
    ...
{% endhighlight %}

I just find it amazing that it is so easy to do and the benefits are great, our code is readable, easy to maintain and we have alot of reusable code.

In conclusion, if you are learning CSS and HTML, or if you have some intermediate knowledge but have problems with organizing your code, I recomend you to go and read the **[BEM docs][bem]** and start implementing it, and the best part is that you can do small modifications to the rules to keep your code even cleaner.

Of course there are other methodologyes to keep your code clean like [SMACSS][smacss] or [Atomic][atm], however, `BEM` is a super simple, easy and powerfull tool anyone can start using from day 1. And if you add [SASS][sass] to it, it just became a thing of beauty.
